Analysis Code for WMuNu Cross-Section Analysis
==============================================

1 . Signal Templates
--------------------

Original programs by Antonio Vilela Pereira 

After 22X, modifyed (basically amplied to new met types) and maintained by M. Cepeda

Programs:

A) "Drop-Muon" method --> WDropMuonTemplate.cc

-> To be run (with test/WTemplateDropMuon.py) on a 10pb-1 sample of ZMuMu
-> Right now it builds the ZMuMu from scratch, a more coherent approach would be to 
modify it to be run on the outcome of the ZMuMu skims (using ZMuMu Candidates)
-> Builds a WMuNu dropping one leg of the Z
-> 3 varieties, a) original   b) boosting to CM   c) using CS angle to account for polarization
-> Not correcting for neutrinos on eta>2.1 (this causes a small difference in the peak of the MT shape
when compared to WMuNu reco data)
-> Still way behind the Random Sampling template when comparing to W MonteCarlo
-> Needs fixing/cleaning



B) "Random Sampling" method. Two steps: ZTemplateForSampling.cc and WRandomTemplate.cc

-> To be run in two steps, first one (test/ztemplate.py) over a 10pb-1 data-sample of ZMuMu --> Met 
distributions vs VPt for sampling
-> Second step (test/WTemplateSampling.py) over a Monte Carlo high stat sample of Ws, taking this Met 
distributions from ZMuMu as input, and re-building the W using
a reconstructed muon (including muon detector effects through ElectroWeakAnalysis/Utilities distortedMuon producer) 
and a randomly obtained "neutrino" obtained from the Z MET information.
-> Two varieties: one uses MET distributions as a function of pt, phi; the other as a function of paralell and 
perpendicular to Z direction


2.  Background Templates
------------------------

Small module to be added after Selection (QCDTemplate.cc, through Background.py)

->Work in progress!! 
->Once Mt corrections have been calculated (just from a linear fit of the mean of MT distribution vs isolation
and the width of the MT distribution vs isolation) from a data-like sample --> parameters p,p'
->Computes the "template" for QCD (inverted isolation, and inverted isolation using the correction described above)
->Right now the program needs to be told both the corrections used and the kind of met used... 
->Near future updates will make it use the 2D output of the WMuNuSelector, do the fit to obtain the corrections, and compute 
the templates in one go :-)...


3. FITs 
-------

Minuit macro that runs over a file containing all the necesary histograms (collected from different programs)

makeInputFileForFit.cpp (run as makeInputFileForFit [-c] corMet, where [-c] asks whether the isolation is combined or not), 
assembles a histogram file with a) Data input b) templates for signal c) templates for background (and MC truth for QCD 
and signal for comparisons)
CrossSectionFIT.cpp (run as root CrossSectionFIT.cpp) does the Fit, and gives some 1D histograms to verify the results

--> In progress!! Fit will be moved to RooFit soon
--> Framework a little bit ackward still... working on it
--> ABCD program based in the same input to be added soon

4. MET Resolution studies
-------------------------
METAnalyzer.cc is just a very simple analyzer to compare MET with generator level met (in the case of a W Sample, it compares with 
the neutrino). It is just intended for resolution studies, just a few histos.
